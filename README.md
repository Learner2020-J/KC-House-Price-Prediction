# KC-House-Price-Prediction
Applications of Machine Learning in Various Fields have helped a lot. Nowadays it is used in almost every customer service industry, increasing business profit, forecasting of weather. In similar way we can use it for prediction of House Prices for different Customers. We will use the technique of Linear Regression to predict. The idea of regression is pretty simple: given enough data, you can observe the relationship between your target parameter (the output) and other parameters (the input), and then apply this relationship function to real observed data. We are using machine learning as it is helpful to get the insights out of data. As, the price of house depends on lots of variables and factors which are many times not taken into consideration while purchasing the house. Using different variables one can find out the relationships among different variables which help to determine the price of house. Lots of Real Estates Company Try to look for Potential buyers who are looking for lots of factors Prices, Square foot area of House, No of Floors, Bedrooms, Bathrooms and a lot of other variables. To get proper Customer and appropriate price we are performing   this Machine Learning Study using the Linear Regression Technique.
